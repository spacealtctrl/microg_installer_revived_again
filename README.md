# microG Installer Revived… Again

A **Magisk / KernelSU module** that converts your installed microG GmsCore from a user app into a **system-level app** to improve **Play Integrity behavior** and testing on custom or rooted devices.  

**Forked from nift4’s microG Installer Revived** — updated to support **microG 0.3.9.250932**.

> **Note:** This module does not bundle or install microG. It promotes your already-installed microG to the system layer with proper privileges. Think of it as a **converter**, not a traditional installer.

## ⚠ Personal Project Notice

This is a personal side project maintained for testing and research. Current support focuses on **microG 0.3.9.250932**.

## Overview

This module allows your **user-installed microG apps** to operate at the system level by promoting them into `/system/priv-app/` using Magisk/KernelSU overlay mechanisms. By doing so, microG:

- Gains system-level privileges required for testing Play Integrity  
- Is treated by Android as a system component without modifying `/system` permanently  
- Allows apps to interact with microG in a closer-to-native environment  
- Leaves your original user-installed apps untouched; the system prioritizes the overlayed copies  

This approach provides a safe, reversible way to **evaluate Play Integrity responses** and improve compatibility in rooted or custom ROM environments.

## Features

- Detects installed microG GmsCore and Companion apps  
- Converts them into **system-level apps** using overlay mechanisms  
- Grants necessary **system permissions** and enables features like **signature spoofing**  
- Reversible: removing the module restores the system to its original state  
- Tested with latest microG releases while remaining compatible with prior 0.3.5+ versions (untested)

## Supported Versions

| Component           | Version Tested |
|--------------------|----------------|
| microG GmsCore      | 0.3.9.250932   |
| microG Companion    | 0.3.9.40226    |
| Older microG        | 0.3.5+ (untested) |

## Requirements

**Do NOT install** if Google Play Services are present.  

1. **Signature spoofing support** – check using the [Signature Spoofing Checker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.vending.signaturecheck)  
   - If unsupported, see [FakeGApps](https://github.com/whew-inc/FakeGApps/releases)  

2. **Pre-installed microG apps** – both GmsCore and Companion must be installed as **user apps** before flashing the module  

---

## Installation

1. Verify signature spoofing is enabled  
2. Install **microG GmsCore 0.3.9.250932** as a user app  
3. Install **microG Companion / Play Store variant** as a user app  
4. Flash this module via Magisk or KernelSU  
5. Reboot  
6. Grant necessary permissions in microG Settings  

> The module automatically detects and converts your user-installed apps to system-level versions during boot.

## Updating microG

For updates **within the 0.3.9.x series**, simply install the new APK — no need to reflash the module.  

Sources:  
- [microG GitHub Releases](https://github.com/microg/GmsCore/releases)  
- [microG F-Droid Repository](https://microg.org/download.html)

## Notes for Play Store Users

- Install the Play Store APK (standard APK, not bundle) **before flashing**  
- Module should detect and convert it automatically  
- Contact the maintainer if detection fails

---

## Testing & Feedback

This module is intended for **testing and improving Play Integrity results**. Testers are encouraged to report:

- System-level behavior of apps interacting with microG  
- Boot and overlay behavior on different ROMs and kernels  
- Any permission, integration, or compatibility anomalies  

**Recommendation:** use secondary devices or emulators and back up important data before testing.

---

## Common Issues

- **Maximum supported version error:** Using a newer microG than supported  
- **Bootloop:** Enter [Magisk Safe Mode](https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/faq.html)  
- **Black screen:** Avoid Magisk Delta’s SuList  
- **App crashes:** Disable KSU Unmount modules for affected apps  
- **Background location warnings:** Retry via App Info → Permissions  
- **Play Store DF-DFERH-01 error:** Enable Device Registration in microG settings
